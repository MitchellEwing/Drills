# DRILL: When to Use Surveys

State whether a survey would be the best option for answering each of the following questions:

1. Popularity of various Uber drivers.

Yes, with a rating scale after the customer has finished the ride.

2. A grocery store wants to know how much people like strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream.

Not necessary, better to look at ice cream sales data.

3. Trojan wants to know whether their condoms are more popular among straight or gay people.

Yes, although will have to apply weights & must consider possibility of bias in responses.

4. Recently, rental rates for HappyCars have increased by 30%, which is quite unusual. You want to find out why this is happening and how to keep the increase going. 

Yes, with a survey about customer's experience & brand awareness. Can use most types of survey questions.

5. Assessing the success rate of a new advertising campaign. 

Yes and no. Can survey about brand awareness, but can also just look at sales data before/after the campaign.

6. Measuring the effect of nurse/patient ratio on patient recovery rates in hospital wards.

No & a survey for this can lead to biased responses.
